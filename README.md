## Hi there

I'm Kehan, a computer science major @ ubc, passionate about building efficient, scalable software and intelligent systems.

### Current Focus

I'm really passionate about backend/fullstack development, machine learning, and automation. I work with Python, Java, and TypeScript (Next.js/React), and have built real-world applications where I see the direct impact of my code.

I have experience in Software Engineering, Machine Learning Infrastructure, and Fullstack Web Development. I've engineered centralized tracking platforms for student lifecycles, built real-time damage detection systems for games, and developed concurrent multi-platform distribution engines.
